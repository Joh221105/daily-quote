# Quote Generator

## Description
A simple web application built with Flask that uses the ZenQuotes API to provide users with inspirational quotes and its author. The application offers two main features: viewing a daily quote or fetching a random quote. This project serves as a practice exercise for working with Flask and making fetch requests to APIs.

## Features
- Daily Quote: Fetches and displays a daily quote.
- Random Quote: Fetches and displays a random quote.
- Flask Integration: Uses Flask to create and manage routes, render HTML templates, and handle server-side logic.
- API Interaction: Utilizes the ZenQuotes API to fetch and display quotes based on user interaction.
- Simple Navigation: Easy-to-use navigation between viewing the daily quote and random quotes.
